AI Usage Documentation for DPS React Challenge

Overview
This document tracks all AI-assisted prompts and decisions made during the development of the German Address Validator application.


Prompts Used

1. Initial Project Setup
Prompt:
"I need to build a German address validator using React, Vite, and the Open PLZ API. The form should have two fields: Locality and Postal Code. 
When a user types a locality, it should auto-fill the postal code if there's only one, or show a dropdown if there are multiple. 
When a user enters a postal code, it should auto-fill the locality. Include 1-second debounce on inputs. Can you help me structure this project?"

AI Assistance:
- Initially generated the code base with cursor prompt. I copied a prompt template from cursor to serve as a guide for generating the folder structure.
- Suggested project structure with separate folders for components, hooks, and services
- Recommended creating a custom useDebounce hook
- Advised on API service layer pattern

Code Generated:
- Basic folder structure
- Initial component scaffolding


2. API Integration
Prompt:
"How do I integrate with the Open PLZ API (https://openplzapi.org/de)? I need to search localities by name and postal codes by code. 
What endpoints should I use and how should I handle the responses?"

AI Assistance:
- Explained the API endpoints: `/Localities?name=` and `/Localities?postalCode=`
- Suggested error handling patterns
- Recommended TypeScript interfaces for type safety

Code Generated:
- `openPlzApi.ts` service file with searchLocalitiesByName and searchPostalCodesByCode functions
- TypeScript interfaces for Locality and PostalCode

Modifications Made:
- Added additional response format handling (array vs object with results/data properties)
- Added validation for 5-digit postal code format
- Enhanced error handling with console logging


3. Debounce Hook Implementation
Prompt:
"Create a custom React hook for debouncing input values with a configurable delay. Default should be 1000ms."

AI Assistance:
- Provided complete useDebounce hook implementation
- Explained the setTimeout/clearTimeout pattern
- Suggested TypeScript generic type for flexibility

Code Generated:
- Complete `useDebounce.ts` hook

Modifications Made:
- None - used as provided


4. Form State Management
Prompt:
"I need to manage complex state for the address form. The postal code field should switch between input and dropdown based on API results. 
How should I structure the state and handle the different scenarios?"

AI Assistance:
- Suggested using multiple useState hooks for different concerns
- Recommended separate flags for tracking user interactions (touched states)
- Advised on preventing infinite loops with proper useEffect dependencies

Code Generated:
- State management structure in AddressForm component
- Initial useEffect hooks for API calls

Modifications Made:
- Added `isSelectingFromDropdown` flag to prevent unnecessary API calls when selecting from dropdown
- Enhanced touched state logic to prevent premature API calls
- Added loading state management

5. Handling Edge Cases
Prompt:
"What edge cases should I handle? For example, what if a user types in one field while the other is auto-filling? Or what if they select from the dropdown?"

AI Assistance:
- Identified key edge cases:
  - User clearing input fields
  - Selecting from dropdown should not trigger new API call
  - Multiple localities with same postal code
  - Invalid postal codes
  - Network errors

Code Generated:
- Conditional logic in useEffect hooks
- Error state management

Modifications Made:
- Added `isSelectingFromDropdown` flag and logic
- Enhanced error messages to be more user-friendly
- Added validation for empty inputs


6. UI/UX Improvements
Prompt:
"How can I improve the user experience? I want to show loading states, error messages, and success indicators. Also need dark mode support."

AI Assistance:
- Suggested Tailwind CSS classes for styling
- Recommended loading spinner animation
- Advised on accessibility attributes (aria-labels, roles)

Code Generated:
- Loading indicator component
- Error and success message displays
- Dark mode styling with Tailwind classes

Modifications Made:
- Customized color scheme to match DPS branding
- Added backdrop blur effect for modern look
- Enhanced accessibility with proper ARIA attributes


7. Preventing Form Submission
Prompt:
"Users are accidentally submitting the form when pressing Enter. How do I prevent this while keeping the form accessible?"

AI Assistance:
- Suggested preventDefault on form submit
- Recommended onKeyDown handler for Enter key
- Advised maintaining keyboard navigation with tabIndex

Code Generated:
- handleKeyDown function
- Form onSubmit handler

Modifications Made:
- None - used as provided


8. TypeScript Type Safety
Prompt:
"Help me add proper TypeScript types for all the event handlers and API responses."

AI Assistance:
- Provided React.ChangeEvent types for input/select handlers
- Suggested proper typing for async functions
- Recommended interface definitions for API data

Code Generated:
- Type annotations throughout the component
- Interface definitions in API service

Modifications Made:
- Added more specific types for state variables
- Enhanced type safety in API response handling


Parts That Were AI-Assisted

1. Complete AI Generation (90-100%):
   - useDebounce hook
   - API service structure
   - TypeScript interfaces

2. Significant AI Assistance (50-90%):
   - AddressForm component structure
   - State management logic
   - Error handling patterns

3. Partial AI Assistance (10-50%):
   - Styling and UI polish
   - Edge case handling
   - Accessibility improvements

4. Manual Implementation (0-10%):
   - Project configuration (Vite, Tailwind)
   - Custom styling adjustments
   - Testing and debugging


Code Snippets Rejected

Rejected Snippet 1: Using axios instead of fetch
Reason: Wanted to keep dependencies minimal and fetch is native

Rejected Snippet 2: Using React Hook Form
Reason: Form is simple enough that useState is sufficient

Rejected Snippet 3: Separate components for input fields
Reason: Over-engineering for this small form; kept it in one component


Decision-Making Process

1. API Integration: Chose to use the Localities endpoint for both searches because it provides more consistent data structure
2. State Management: Decided against Redux/Context as the state is localized to one component
3. Styling: Used Tailwind CSS for rapid development and easy dark mode support
4. Debouncing: Implemented custom hook instead of using lodash to reduce bundle size
5. Error Handling: Chose user-friendly messages over technical error details


Testing Approach

Manual testing performed for:
- Valid German postal codes (e.g., 10115 Berlin, 80331 München)
- Invalid postal codes
- Localities with single postal code
- Localities with multiple postal codes
- Empty input handling
- Rapid typing (debounce testing)
- Dropdown selection behavior


Future Improvements (Not Implemented)

1. Add unit tests with Vitest
2. Add E2E tests with Playwright
3. Implement autocomplete suggestions while typing
4. Add street address validation
5. Cache API responses to reduce network calls
6. Add internationalization support
7. Implement form submission and data persistence


Notes

- All AI interactions were used to accelerate development and ensure best practices
- Code was reviewed and tested manually before committing
- AI suggestions were evaluated critically and modified where necessary
- Focus was on clean, maintainable code over clever solutions
